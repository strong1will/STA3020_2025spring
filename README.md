Based on instructor: Jiasheng Shi's notes. 
The content mainly focus on Point estimation & Hypothesis Testing.

Main Textbook: E.L Lehmann Theory of point estimation & Testing Statistical Hypothesis
Also, some other university's notes all used as a reference. (DUKE STA532/732, ZJU Mathematical statistics, PKU, CMU)

And I will also recommend 2 books, Keener theoratical statistics and 韦来生 数理统计. Keener's book talks more about modern statistics while the later one provides some high quality assignment questions.
